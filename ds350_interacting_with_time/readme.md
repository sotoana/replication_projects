## Case Study 9: Interacting with time

### Background

Your data science income has ballooned and you need to find somewhere to invest your $25,000 you saved over the last year. You have a savvy investment friend who is kind enough to tell you ten stocks he has been watching in the previous year. You will need to visualize the last five years' performance to support the conversation with your friend.

### Tasks

- [ ] For your coding development use these tickers - `tikcers_use = ["CXW", "F", "GM", "JCP", "KR", "WDC", "NKE","T", "WDAY", "WFC", "WMT"]`
- [ ] Use `lets-plot` and `plotly`to build interactive visualizations of the stock performances over the last 5 years.
- [ ] Make a graphic that helps you support a solid question around how an investor would use volume in their trading strategy
- [ ] Create an `.qmd` file with 1-2 paragraphs summarizing your graphics and the choices you made in your visualization
- [ ] Create a self contained .html file to submit on canvas
